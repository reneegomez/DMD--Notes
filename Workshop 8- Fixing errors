# Extra Notes

Debug area is where xcode explains what the error is. 

Brackets are used to close classes and functions. One of the most common error is forgetting tp use brackets }.

Problems with UIElements: if want to change name of outlet or action will need to break connection first before doing it. You can find all connections in the connection inspector, and if error occurs it tells you where you have gone wrong. 

With matching variables and functions if connected properly the variiable will turn green, if it does not it means it was not connected properly. 

When creating a language for a function use camel casing to ensure that spellings are consistent so you can call the function. If it is not spelled propely you will not be able to call the function. 

adding a (!) it acts as an extra confirmation for xcode that you are sure you are sending it to the right place when dealing with conflicting types in your ViewController and Storyboard.
