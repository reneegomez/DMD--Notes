# Extra Notes: 

When writing return value use (->)
1. _let= unchangeable_
1. _var= modifiable format_

**What is a function?**

A pat of code that delivers an action. 

**Give an example (with an explanation) of how you write a function with no arguments**

```swift

func doSomething(){
print(" Renee")
}

```

This is an example of a function without an argument. as there is not string therefore you are not telling it to do something. 

**Show how you would "call" this function.**

```swift

 func doSomething()
 }
 
 ```
 
**What are function "arguments" or "parameters?"**

Arguments are a form of code that tells it to do somehting. 

**Give an example (with an explanation) of how you write a function with one argument.**

```swift 

func somethingelse (word: String) {
print (" Hello\(word)"

```

**Show how you would "call" this function.**

```swift 

func somethingelse()

```

**Give an example (with an explanation) of how you write a function with multiple arguments of different types.**

``` swift 

func another function (x: Int, y Int)
print(x + y)

```

A function with multipe arguments are types of coding with more than one actions.

**Show how you would "call" this function.**

``` swift

anotherfunction()

```

This is referring back to the code to figure out what x and y is. 

**What are return values?**

-> When you ask the code for somehting back like an answer. 

**Give an example of a function that returns a value.**

```swift 

func add( x: Int, y: int -> Int { 
return x+y

```

**Show how you would "call" this function**

```swift 

func add()

```

**How do you access functions of a class? Give an example.**

with a. 

```swift 

me. Hello()

```
